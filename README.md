# JS Project Proposal: Blockhead

### Background:

Blockhead is a game that is based on the 3D puzzle game bloxors, in which the players must move a rectangular prism across a board into a hole. The main differences with this game will be as follows:

1. The view will be strictly overhead.
2. Players will have a limited number of moves at their disposal. Step onto the same space too many times and it disappears.

### Functionality & MVP:

Blockhead

- [ ] Render boards to the screen
- [ ] Make board tiles change color/disappear depending number of steps taken
- [ ] Make block movable with arrow keys.
- [ ] production README

### Architecture and Technologies:

- 'JavaScript' (game logic)
- 'React' (?) (rendering of board tiles)
- 'Webpack' (bundle JS files)

The game will require the following files:

- 'board.js' to handle the board logic in response to player input
- 'block.js' to handle the movement logic for the block
- 'level.js' to handle transitioning between levels on success

### Wireframes:

The app is contained in one screen with nav links to my Github and LinkedIn in the top left corner. Control of the game is toggled with the mouse, and in the game players can move the block with the arrow keys.

### Implementation Timeline:

**Day 1:** Setup Node modules

**Day 2:** Render the board with basic logic.

**Day 3:** Create the controllable block to move around.

### Bonus Features:
